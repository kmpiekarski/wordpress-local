#Getting started

Install npm either through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) or [brew](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
npm i @wordpress/env
```

`.wp-env.json` is for configuring the WordPress instance

This setup is meant to avoid installing *wp-env* globally. Find shortcut scripts in `package.json` for running *wp-env* and *wp cli* scripts within the docker container.

DB migration and deployment coming soon...
